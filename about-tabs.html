        <h2>A little about me.</h2>
        <p>
          I began dabbling in metalsmithing at the De Cordova museum where I worked with sterling silver sheet tubs and wire construction. I came to the realization that this trade requires a lot of tools and a studio space separate from living quarters.
        </p>
        <p>
          An easier rout for me was to design jewelry using Swarovski Crystals and sterling silver findings that I could purchase on the web. I found myself wanting to reshape these clasp and connector findings and delved further into metalsmithing.
        </p>
        <p>
          This further delving brought me to Mass College of Art where I took a construction in base and precious materials class with Donna Vevecka. Here I could use their open studio space as long as I was enrolled. I spent some long hot days annealing copper wire and drawing it through plates for a thinner guage just so I could use the draw tongs and bench.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I discovered Metalwerx in Waltham where they use this very innovative material call PMC, precious metal clay. It's fine silver mixed with a gluten to give it the consistency of clay. The gluten burns off in the kiln and what's left is fine silver. 
        </p>
        <blockquote>Ahh jewelry development just became a lot more accessable. I don't need a lot of space and machinery to make fine silver pieces.
        </blockquote>
